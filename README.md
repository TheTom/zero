# Zero

A local-first AI coding terminal in Rust with **zero runtime dependencies**.
Built to feel like Claude Code's terminal, designed first for local LLMs.

## Repo map

Flat by design — three crates, one file per concern, no deep nesting.

**Pure cores carry the logic and the tests; the only `unsafe` is `term.rs`.**
The seam that keeps the UI swappable is `zero_core::Backend` — the terminal
talks only to that trait, so the real model drops in without UI changes.

## Run

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/zero            # interactive (needs a real terminal)
./target/release/zero --stub     # force the built-in echo backend
./target/release/zero --no-log   # no session transcript
```

## Connecting a model

Zero talks to any OpenAI-compatible server (llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama's shim, …).
With no backend configured it runs a stub that echoes your input.

Config lives at `~/.zero/config.json` (created on first run):

```json
{
  "base_url": "http://gx10-a309.local:8000",
  "model": "Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-...-Q5_K_M.gguf",
  "api_key": "",
  "temperature": null,
  "system_prompt": ""
}
```

CLI flags override the file:

```bash
zero --url http://gx10-a309.local:8000 --model qwen-heretic
zero --api-key sk-...        # bearer token, if your server needs one
zero --config ./other.json   # use a specific config file
```

`/config` inside the app shows the active backend and model. Plain `http://`
only (Zero is local-first; no TLS).

Sessions log to `~/.zero/sessions/zero-<unixtime>.jsonl`.

### Keys

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `^A` / `^E`, `Home` / `End` | start / end of line |
| `^B` / `^F` | back / forward one char |
| `⌥←` / `⌥→`, `^←` / `^→` | back / forward one word |
| `^W` | delete word back |
| `^U` / `^K` | kill to start / end of line |
| `^L` | clear screen |
| `^J` | insert newline — multiline input (works in every terminal) |
| `Shift+Enter` / `⌥+Enter` | insert newline (on terminals that send a distinct code) |
| `Enter` | submit |
| `↑` / `↓` | move between input lines, else recall history |
| `^R` | reverse history search (type to match, `^R` for older, `Enter` accept, `Esc` cancel) |
| `Esc Esc` | clear the line |
| `^C` | clear the line; on an empty line, `^C` again to exit |
| `^D` | exit on an empty line |

### Shell mode & the safety guard

Prefix a line with `!` to run it as a shell command inline (`!cargo test`,
`!git status`). Output, exit code, and measured time print in place.

Every command — `!` shell now, agent tool calls later — passes through a
**destructive-command guard** (`zero-core::safety`) first. It's a hard, in-code
classifier, not a soft prompt rule: catastrophic commands (`rm -rf` on a
critical path, `git reset --hard`, `dd of=/dev/…`, `sudo`, fork bombs, …) are
flagged and require an explicit `y/N` confirmation before they run. The lesson
from other harnesses is that prompt-level rules don't stop `rm -rf ~`; a gate at
the execution boundary does.

> **Multiline / Shift+Enter:** Zero enables the kitty keyboard protocol on
> startup, so Shift+Enter works on terminals that support it (kitty, WezTerm,
> Ghostty, recent iTerm2). On terminals that don't, **`^J` is the universal
> newline key** (Return sends CR = submit, `^J` sends LF = newline). Word-wise
> moves (`⌥`/`^` + arrows) likewise depend on the terminal sending the sequence.

## Test & coverage

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
./scripts/coverage.sh                  # enforces >=98% (fails the build below)
```

**Line coverage is held at ≥98%** (currently ~99%) and enforced by
`scripts/coverage.sh`. The only excluded files are `term.rs` (libc FFI — can't
run without a real tty) and `main.rs` (process bootstrap); all engine and TUI
logic is covered, including the HTTP/SSE client (tested against an in-process
localhost mock). `cargo-llvm-cov` is a dev tool, not a crate dependency.

### Pre-push gate

`scripts/hooks/pre-push` blocks a push unless: (1) no AI / co-author attribution
in any pushed commit, (2) tests pass, (3) line coverage stays ≥98%. Enable it
once per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks
```

## Toolchain note

Pinned to Rust **1.93.1** because the machine's `stable` toolchain has a
corrupted `rust-std` (missing std libs → "can't find crate for std"). Repair:
`rustup toolchain uninstall stable && rustup toolchain install stable`, then
bump the pin.
