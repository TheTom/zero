# Zero

A local-first AI coding terminal in Rust with **zero runtime dependencies**.
Built to feel like Claude Code's terminal, designed first for local LLMs.

## Repo map

Flat by design — three crates, one file per concern, no deep nesting.

```

    └── zero/               the binary — args, wiring

```

**Pure cores carry the logic and the tests; the only `unsafe` is `term.rs`.**
The seam that keeps the UI swappable is `zero_core::Backend` — the terminal
talks only to that trait, so the real model drops in without UI changes.

## Run

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/zero            # interactive (needs a real terminal)
./target/release/zero --instant  # no streaming delay
./target/release/zero --no-log   # no session transcript
```

Sessions log to `~/.zero/sessions/zero-<unixtime>.jsonl`.

### Keys

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `^A` / `^E`, `Home` / `End` | start / end of line |
| `^B` / `^F` | back / forward one char |
| `⌥←` / `⌥→`, `^←` / `^→` | back / forward one word |
| `^W` | delete word back |
| `^U` / `^K` | kill to start / end of line |
| `^L` | clear screen |
| `Shift+Enter` / `⌥+Enter` | insert newline (multiline input) |
| `Enter` | submit |
| `↑` / `↓` | move between input lines, else recall history |
| `^R` | reverse history search (type to match, `^R` for older, `Enter` accept, `Esc` cancel) |
| `Esc Esc` | clear the line |
| `^C` | clear the line; on an empty line, `^C` again to exit |
| `^D` | exit on an empty line |

> **Shift+Enter caveat:** terminals only send a distinct Shift+Enter when they
> support the modern CSI-u/kitty keyboard protocol (kitty, WezTerm, recent
> iTerm2). Elsewhere it reads as plain Enter; use `⌥+Enter` (meta+Enter), which
> more terminals send as `ESC CR`. Word-wise moves (`⌥`/`^` + arrows) likewise
> depend on the terminal sending the modifier sequence.

## Test & coverage

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
./scripts/coverage.sh                  # enforces >=98% (fails the build below)
```

**Coverage is held at ≥98%** (lines, functions, regions) and enforced by
`scripts/coverage.sh`. The only excluded files are `term.rs` (libc FFI — can't
run without a real tty) and `main.rs` (process bootstrap); all engine and TUI
logic is covered. `cargo-llvm-cov` is a dev tool, not a crate dependency.

### Pre-push gate

`scripts/hooks/pre-push` blocks a push unless: (1) no AI / co-author attribution
in any pushed commit, (2) tests pass, (3) coverage stays ≥98%. Enable it once
per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks
```

## Toolchain note

Pinned to Rust **1.93.1** because the machine's `stable` toolchain has a
corrupted `rust-std` (missing std libs → "can't find crate for std"). Repair:
`rustup toolchain uninstall stable && rustup toolchain install stable`, then
bump the pin.
